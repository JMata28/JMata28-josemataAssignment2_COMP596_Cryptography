This is the answer for Question #4 of Assignment 2 of the class COMP 596 - Cryptography

The question is shown below:

Use a common programming language to implement the initialization and
generation of keystream in RC4 (with a self-selected secret key as Initialization
Vector) and encryption of plaintext using XOR operation and decryption of
ciphertext using XOR operation (few bytes of plaintext is enough for the test).
You can have encryption and decryption in the same file and come up with your
own secret key K[]. Please donâ€™t forget to submit your original code.
